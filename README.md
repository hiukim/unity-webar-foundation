# Unity WebAR Foundation
Unity WebAR Foundation is a unity package for building WebGL based AR applications for Unity. It's similar to ARFoundation, but for building web app instead of native app. The package itself is a wrapper around popular WebAR SDKs. 

The package can be obtained here: [Unity WebAR Foundation](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/webar-foundation-250806)

At this point, it supports Image Tracking and Face Tracking AR effects.

# Sample projects
Checkout our [Sample Projects](https://hiukim.github.io/unity-webar-foundation/examples.html) here (with live URL for you to try)

All the source code of the demo projects can be found in this repo under `sample-projects`. Noted that you will need to obtain the `unity-webar-foundation` package and import it in the project before you can run it.
